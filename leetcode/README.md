# My Leetcode Solutions

I only use leetcode as my first step on the path to learning new languages. It's safe to assume solutions presented here reflect days 1-7 of picking up a new language, so they're far from perfect, often miss obvious best-practices, and are not representative of my work today.

Runtime and memory usage for the algorithm is listed in the description of the latest commit to the folder.
