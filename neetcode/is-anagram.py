# Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

# An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

# Output: false
# Constraints:

# s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        t = list(t)
        try:
            for letter in s:
                t.remove(letter)
            if len(t) > 0:
                return False
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            return False
